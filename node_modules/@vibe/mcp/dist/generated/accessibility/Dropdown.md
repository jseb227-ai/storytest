# Dropdown - Accessibility Requirements

1. Using an `id` is highly recommended for all instances to ensure proper label association.
2. Always provide a `label` prop to ensure the dropdown's purpose is clear to all users.
3. Use `ariaLabel` prop when you need to provide a custom accessible name for the dropdown.
4. Use `inputAriaLabel` prop when you need to provide a specific accessible name for the input field in
      searchable dropdowns.
5. Use `menuAriaLabel` prop when you need to provide a custom accessible name for the dropdown menu.
6. Use `autoFocus` prop when the dropdown should receive initial focus for keyboard navigation.
