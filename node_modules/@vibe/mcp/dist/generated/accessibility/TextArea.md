# TextArea - Accessibility Requirements

1. Using an `id` is highly recommended for all instances to ensure the best accessibility.
2. Always provide a visible `label` to ensure the textarea's purpose is clear to all users.
3. When using `label` or `helpText`, you must also provide an `id`. This is crucial,
      as it allows screen readers to correctly associate the textarea with its label and description.
4. For required fields, use the `required` prop to ensure proper screen reader announcements and native
      browser validation.
5. Provide descriptive error messages using the `error` prop with `helpText` to help users
      understand and correct validation issues.
6. The component automatically sets `aria-invalid` when validation fails, including when character count
      exceeds `maxLength`.
7. Character counting with `showCharCount` automatically provides accessibility labels for screen readers.
8. Use the `aria-label` prop when a visible label is not desired but accessibility support is still
      needed.
9. The component automatically handles `aria-describedby` attributes for help text and character limit
      information when applicable.
