# TextField - Accessibility Requirements

1. Using an `id` is highly recommended for all instances to ensure the best accessibility.
2. Always provide a visible `title` or an `inputAriaLabel` to ensure the input's purpose is
      clear to all users.
3. When using `title` or validation text, you must also provide an `id`. This is crucial, as it
      allows screen readers to correctly associate the input with its label and description.
4. For required fields, use the `required` prop to ensure proper screen reader announcements and native
      browser validation.
5. Provide descriptive error messages using `validation` prop with status 'error' to help users understand
      and correct validation issues.
6. When using icons, provide meaningful labels through `iconsNames.primary` and{" "}
      `iconsNames.secondary` props for screen reader users.
7. For search inputs, use `type='search'` and provide `searchResultsContainerId` to properly
      associate with search results.
8. Character counting with `showCharCount` automatically provides accessibility labels for screen readers.
