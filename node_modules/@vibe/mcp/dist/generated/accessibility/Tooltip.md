# Tooltip - Accessibility Requirements

1. Provide an `id` for the Tooltip to enable proper accessibility associations and unique identification.
2. Ensure tooltip content is descriptive and provides meaningful information. Avoid using tooltips to repeat
      information that's already visible in the UI.
3. Configure `showTrigger` and `hideTrigger` events to ensure tooltips are accessible via both
      mouse and keyboard interactions.
4. Use `hideWhenReferenceHidden` prop to ensure tooltips disappear when their reference elements are
      hidden or removed from the DOM.
5. Avoid placing critical information only in tooltips - ensure the core functionality is accessible without tooltips
      for users who cannot see them.
