# Link - Accessibility Requirements

1. Use the `ariaLabelDescription` prop when the link text alone doesn't provide enough context for screen
      readers to understand the link's purpose.
2. Use `ariaDescribedby` prop to link the link to additional descriptive text that provides more context
      about the link's destination or action.
3. Use `ariaLabeledBy` prop when an external element provides the accessible name for the link. Pass the{" "}
      `id` of that external element.
