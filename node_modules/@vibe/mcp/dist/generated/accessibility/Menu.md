# Menu - Accessibility Requirements

1. Provide an `id` for the Menu to enable proper accessibility associations and unique identification.
2. Use the `ariaLabel` prop to provide a meaningful accessible name for the menu that describes its
      purpose (e.g., "Navigation menu", "Actions menu", "Options menu").
3. Use the `ariaDescribedBy` prop to link the menu to additional descriptive text by providing the{" "}
      `id` of the descriptive element.
4. It is recommended to use `focusItemIndexOnMount={0}` to focus the first menu item when the menu opens.
5. Ensure menu items have clear, descriptive text or use appropriate `ariaLabel` props on individual menu
      items for icon-only items.
