# Combobox - Accessibility Requirements

1. Using an `id` is highly recommended for all instances to ensure proper label association.
2. Use `searchInputAriaLabel` prop when you need to provide a custom accessible name for the search input.
3. Use `disabled` prop appropriately to indicate when the combobox is not available for interaction.
4. Use `autoFocus` prop when the combobox should receive initial focus for keyboard navigation.
