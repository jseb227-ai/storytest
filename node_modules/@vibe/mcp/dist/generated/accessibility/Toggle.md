# Toggle - Accessibility Requirements

1. Using an `id` is highly recommended for all instances to ensure proper label association.
2. Use `ariaLabel` prop when you need to provide additional context for screen readers.
3. Use `ariaLabelledBy` prop when an external element provides the accessible name for the toggle.
4. Use `ariaControls` prop when the toggle controls other elements on the page.
5. Use `disabled` prop appropriately to indicate when toggles are not available for interaction.
