# RadioButton - Accessibility Requirements

1. Using an `id` is recommended for all instances to ensure proper label association.
2. Always provide a `text` prop to ensure the radio button's purpose is clear to all users.
3. Use the same `name` prop for all radio buttons in a group to ensure proper keyboard navigation and
      screen reader grouping.
4. Use `disabled` prop appropriately to indicate when radio buttons are not available for interaction.
5. Use `disabledReason` prop to provide an explanation for disabled radio buttons, shown in a tooltip.
6. Use `autoFocus` prop when a radio button should receive initial focus for keyboard navigation.
7. Use `childrenTabIndex` prop to control the tab order when radio buttons have interactive children.
8. Use `retainChildClick` prop to control whether clicking on children triggers radio button selection.
