# Checkbox - Accessibility Requirements

1. Using an `id` is highly recommended for all instances to ensure proper label association.
2. Always provide a visible `label` prop to ensure the checkbox's purpose is clear to all users.
3. It is recommended to use `separateLabel` mode for better screen reader support as it provides clearer,
      more explicit label-input associations. When using this mode, the `id` prop is required for proper
      label association.
4. Use `ariaLabel` prop when you need to provide a custom accessible name.
5. Use `ariaLabelledBy` prop when the checkbox is described by external elements.
6. Use `indeterminate` prop for mixed selection states (e.g., when some but not all sub-items are
      selected).
7. Use `tabIndex` prop for custom keyboard navigation order.
8. Use `autoFocus` prop when the checkbox should receive initial focus for keyboard navigation.
