# MenuItem - Accessibility Requirements

1. Use the `ariaLabel` prop when you need to provide a custom accessible name that differs from the
      visible title text, especially for icon-only menu items.
2. For menu items with submenus, ensure the submenu content is properly structured with descriptive menu item titles
      for clear navigation hierarchy.
3. Use the `disabled` prop appropriately with a `disableReason` to provide context for why a
      menu item cannot be selected.
