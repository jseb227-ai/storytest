# Avatar - Accessibility Requirements

1. Always provide an `ariaLabel` prop to describe the person or entity represented by the avatar (e.g.,
      "John Smith", "Design Team", "Guest User"). This label is automatically used as tooltip content.
2. Use the `role` prop when the avatar represents something other than a person (e.g.,{" "}
      `role="img"` for team avatars, `role="button"` for clickable workspace avatars).
3. For clickable avatars, ensure the `ariaLabel` describes the action that will occur when clicked (e.g.,
      "Open John Smith's profile", "View Design Team details").
4. Use `ariaHidden` prop appropriately when the avatar is purely decorative and provides no meaningful
      information to screen readers.
5. For avatars with badges (status indicators), ensure the `ariaLabel` includes relevant status
      information (e.g., "John Smith (Away)", "Design Team (3 members online)").
