# NumberField - Accessibility Requirements

1. Using an `id` is highly recommended for all instances to ensure the best accessibility.
2. Always provide a visible `label` or an `aria-label` to ensure the input's purpose is clear
      to all users.
3. When using `label` or `infoText`, you must also provide an `id`. This is crucial,
      as it allows screen readers to correctly associate the input with its label and description.
4. Providing an `id` also automatically links the Increment and Decrement buttons to the input via the{" "}
      `aria-controls` attribute, further improving the experience for users of assistive technologies.
