# IconButton - Accessibility Requirements

1. Provide an `id` for the IconButton to enable proper accessibility associations and unique
      identification.
2. Always provide an accessible name using either `ariaLabel` prop or `tooltipContent` prop.
      The component automatically uses `tooltipContent` as the accessible name if no `ariaLabel`{" "}
      is provided.
3. Use `ariaLabel` prop when you need a different accessible name than the tooltip text, or when the icon
      button doesn't have a tooltip.
4. Use `ariaLabeledBy` prop when an external element provides the accessible name for the icon button.
      Pass the `id` of that external element.
5. Use `ariaHasPopup` prop when the icon button opens a menu, dialog, or popup.
6. Use `ariaExpanded` prop to indicate when a popup or menu opened by the icon button is currently open (
      `true`) or closed (`false`).
7. Use `ariaControls` prop to link the icon button to the element it controls. Pass the `id` of
      the controlled element.
8. Use `aria-describedby` prop to link the icon button to additional descriptive text. Pass the{" "}
      `id` of the descriptive element.
9. Use `aria-pressed` prop for toggle icon buttons to indicate their current pressed state (
      `true`, `false`, or `mixed`).
10. Use `aria-hidden` prop appropriately to hide the icon button from screen readers when necessary, but
      use sparingly as it removes the button from the accessibility tree entirely.
11. Use `tabIndex` prop to control the icon button's position in the keyboard navigation order. The default
      value allows normal tab navigation.
12. Provide `disabledReason` prop when disabling an icon button to give users context about why the button
      is unavailable. This will be displayed in the tooltip.
