# AvatarGroup - Accessibility Requirements

1. Use the `counterAriaLabel` prop to provide a descriptive accessible name for the counter (e.g., "3
      additional team members", "5 more participants", "2 hidden collaborators").
2. Ensure each `Avatar` in the group has a meaningful `ariaLabel` prop that describes the
      person or entity (e.g., "John Smith", "Sarah Johnson", "Design Team").
