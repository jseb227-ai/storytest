# Button - Accessibility Requirements

1. Using an `id` is recommended for all instances to ensure proper label association.
2. Always provide descriptive text content for buttons, or use `ariaLabel` prop when buttons contain only
      icons.
3. Use `ariaLabel` prop when you need to provide a custom accessible name that differs from the visible
      button text or for icon-only buttons.
4. Use `ariaLabeledBy` prop when an external element provides the accessible name for the button.
5. Use `ariaHasPopup` prop when the button triggers a popup menu or dialog.
6. Use `ariaExpanded` prop to indicate when a popup triggered by the button is open or closed.
7. Use `ariaControls` prop to link the button to the element it controls.
8. Use `aria-describedby` prop when additional descriptive text is needed for the button.
9. Use `aria-pressed` prop for toggle buttons to indicate their current pressed state.
