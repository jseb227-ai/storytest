# AttentionBox - Accessibility Requirements

1. Always provide clear, descriptive `title` and `text` content. The title should be concise
      and the text should provide actionable information that helps users understand what they need to do.
2. For dismissible AttentionBoxes, use the `closeButtonAriaLabel` prop to provide a descriptive accessible
      name for the close button.
