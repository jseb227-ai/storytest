# Tabs - Accessibility Requirements

1. Provide an `id` for the `TabList` and individual `Tab` components to enable
      proper accessibility associations and unique identification.
2. Ensure each `Tab` has clear, descriptive text content or appropriate icon with accessible name to
      indicate what content will be displayed when selected.
3. Use the `tabPanelIds` prop in `TabList` to establish proper relationships between tabs and
      their corresponding tab panels. Pass an array of `TabPanel` IDs in the same order as the tabs.
4. Provide unique `id` props for each `TabPanel` to enable the `aria-controls`
      relationships established by the tabs.
