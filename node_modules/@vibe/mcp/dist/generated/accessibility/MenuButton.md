# MenuButton - Accessibility Requirements

1. Provide an `id` for the MenuButton to enable proper accessibility associations.
2. Use descriptive `ariaLabel` values for MenuButtons that clearly indicate the menu's purpose.
3. Use `ariaControls` prop to link the MenuButton to its menu content. Pass the `id` of the
      menu element to establish the relationship between the button and its controlled menu.
